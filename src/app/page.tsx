<h2>FAQs for Instagram Downloader</h2>
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the iGram Saver and downloading stuff from Instagram. These questions generally come to the mind of most people who download Instagram videos or reels.
</p>

<div>
<p>In today's digital world, Instagram has become such a social network in which the number of users is increasing at an incredible rate. If you are using this tool, it means that you are also an Instagram user. When we use Instagram, sometimes we get to see some videos which we feel like saving, the save feature is also there in Instagram but saving in the phone's gallery is considered better. This is where our Instagram downloader comes in handy.</p>
<p>Let's see from a different perspective when our Instagram downloader can be most useful to you.</p>
<p>"You are a PC gamer who enjoys playing different types of games, and suddenly, you find a video in your feed that is a tutorial for building a good PC. In such a situation, if you bookmark it, then it is possible that the video may get deleted later. If you save that video with the save feature of Instagram, then later you may have trouble finding the same video. But if you download that video and keep it in the phone's gallery, then you can access that video anytime later."</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>"You are fond of making different types of dishes with different recipes and you find a great cooking video in your Instagram feed which has a specific type of recipe. In this situation also, downloading and saving that video is a better solution. Then later you can cook by watching that video."</p>
<p>So now you must have understood which method is best for you. Downloading the video is better than saving it in any other way. When we share a link to a video on WhatsApp or any other platform, most people don't even open it and watch it. But when we share the video itself, there are more chances that people will watch it.</p>
<p>Along with this, our Instagram video downloader tool provides better services than any other Instagram downloader available on the internet. Because to download any Instagram video, you only need the link of that video. After that you can easily download that Instagram video and save it in your phone, tablet or computer.</p>
<p><strong>Errors you may encounter while downloading Instagram videos</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common errors you may encounter while downloading any Instagram video with iGram Saver is "The video link for this post is not public." This error occurs when you try to download private Instagram videos, which our tool does not allow.</p>
